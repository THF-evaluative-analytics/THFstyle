# THFstyles
Functions to make plots look Health Foundation branded.

## Installing bbplot

`THFstyles` is not on CRAN, so you will have to install it directly from Github using `devtools`. 

If you do not have the `devtools` package installed, you will have to run the first line in the code below as well. 


```
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('bbc/bbplot')
```
