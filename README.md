# THFstyle
Functions to make outputs look Health Foundation branded. We are starting with plots but will eventually add templates for Rmarkdown etc.

## Installing THFstyle

`THFstyle` is not on CRAN, so you will have to install it directly from Github using `devtools`. 

If you do not have the `devtools` package installed, you will have to run the first line in the code below as well. 


```
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('THF-evaluative-analytics/THFstyle')
```
